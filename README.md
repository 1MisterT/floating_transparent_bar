# GNOME Shell Extension - Transparent Top Bar

A GNOME Shell extension that makes the top bar transparent when free-floating.

This is basically a copy of the feature implementation [removed in GNOME Shell 3.32](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/merge_requests/376/). I modified the code a bit to make it an extension. Enjoy!
