# GNOME Shell Extension - Transparent Top Bar

A GNOME Shell extension that brings back the transparent top bar when free-floating in GNOME Shell 3.32.

This basically comes from the feature implementation [removed in GNOME Shell 3.32](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/merge_requests/376/), and I modified the code a bit to make it an extension. Enjoy!
